# Gamification of Clustering
## How to play
- Select your dataset of choice and your username
- Start the game, and try to find the best clusters you can using linear correlations
- You can check your current score in the submit panel, as well as committing your score. The top 10 scores for the selected dataset are listed.

## Known Bugs and their workarounds
- A line has to be dragged before calculating scores and submitting to prevent crashes
- Drag the line away from their starting position before creating a new one to avoid points overlapping


# Disclaimer
Your score, submitted result and activity log (for the game) are stored in a database to be analyzed for my bachelors thesis. Good luck and have fun!
